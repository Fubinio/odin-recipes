                    <li>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat
                        until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>

                        Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes.
                        Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until spinach has wilted and sausage
